[#TidyTuesday](https://mobile.twitter.com/hashtag/TidyTuesday?src=hashtag_click) submission, a plot of [#Anime](https://mobile.twitter.com/hashtag/Anime?src=hashtag_click) age ratings by genre. Seems that there a lot of PG-13 titles and especially in the comedy genre. Also, no R titles in the kids genre ðŸ¤”
