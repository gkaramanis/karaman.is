Credit to timb for the idea in this [thread](https://getsatisfaction.com/thingm/topics/blink_if_there_a_unread_mails_in_mail_app).

1. Create a new AppleScript with this code

2. Save the script in ~/Library/ApplicationScripts/com.apple.mail/

3. Create a rule in Mail.app that will run the script every time you get a new mail.
