I came across the idea when I saw [Cédric](https://twitter.com/CedScherer)’s gif in his tutorial [The Evolution of a ggplot (Ep. 1)](https://cedricscherer.netlify.app/2019/05/17/the-evolution-of-a-ggplot-ep.-1/).

I was already saving lots of plots, in order to compare them when I changed or tried things, so I just added a couple of steps in the workflow. 

1. I save every plot as a png with ggsave inside a temp folder, add timestamp in the filename for easier sorting:

		ggsave(here::here("2020-week27", "plots", "temp",
			paste0("xmen-", format(Sys.time(), "%Y%m%d_%H%M%S"),
			".png")), dpi = 320, width = 9, height = 9)

2. I resize the images in Terminal, with 1024 as the max width or height. I use sips that comes with MacOS:

        sips -Z 1024 *.png

3. I stitch the images with [Gif Brewery 3](https://gfycat.com/gifbrewery), set 2 seconds duration for the first frame and 3 seconds for the last one.

[Jose](https://twitter.com/perspectivalean) used another approach by overwriting ggplot, read how [here](https://github.com/JoseEchave/sharedfunctions/blob/master/ggplot_progression_gif/autosave%20ggplot.Rmd).
