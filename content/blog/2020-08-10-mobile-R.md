This is a little post about how I use R when I want to make changes in my code or test things and canâ€™t sit in front of a big screen.

I have installed the following:  
#### iMac (it's always on) ####  
- R  
- ssh/[mosh](https://mosh.org). Mosh to stay connected on mobile  
- [radian](https://github.com/randy3k/radian) (requires R, python)  

#### iPhone ####  
- [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com). Code editor to edit scripts.

- [Blink](https://blink.sh). ssh client, I use it for mosh, Textastic has built-in ssh as well. Use it to connect to iMac, start radian, run the scripts or test code in radian  

#### iMac and iPhone ####  
- Synced folders (I use iCloud) where the scripts live and plots are saved as images.  
&nbsp;

Simple workflow:
1. Start ssh/mosh client on iPhone 
2. Start radian on iMac
3. Write code in radian and see results

Working with plots or bigger scripts, I first write the script in RStudio on my iMac. When I want to write more code or change it on my phone:
1. Edit the script in the code editor
2. ssh and run the script with source() in radian
3. If I make a plot, I save it as an image and then view it with Files
