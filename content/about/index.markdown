# Hi, I'm Georgios

I was born in Thessaloniki, Greece. I've been living and working in Uppsala, Sweden since 2007.

Most of the time I take [photos](/blog) and [visualizations](/dataviz). Sometimes I make [sketches](/sketches), [music](/music) or other [stuff](http://www.georgioskaramanis.com/stuff). I like street photography, portrait and the color orange. You can read more about me in [this interview](http://blog.eyeem.com/?p=12443).

I'm also a [psychiatrist](http://www.akademiska.se) and a [wannapreneur](http://oddquirk.com). I used to wear glasses.
