# Alfred v2 workflows

##   


## Delete all empty folders

A simple applescript to recursively delete all empty folders and subfolders in the frontmost Finder window.

Original script by [twtwtw](https://discussions.apple.com/people/twtwtw), found [here](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4478767).

## Should I watch this movie with Google suggest

I combined two of the workflows that come with Alfred v2 to make this one.

You still use the "movie" keyword like before but you now get a list of suggestions as you type the title.
