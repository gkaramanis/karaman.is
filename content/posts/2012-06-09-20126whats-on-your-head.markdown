A week ago I attended a street photography workshop with [Eric Kim](http://erickimphotography.com/blog/) at Fotografiska in Stockholm.

Lots of inspiration and nice people. I didn't make the best images but I went way out of my comfort zone which is always good!

Here are the photos of the project I had.
