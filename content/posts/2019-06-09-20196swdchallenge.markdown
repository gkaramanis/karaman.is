First [#SWDchallenge](https://mobile.twitter.com/hashtag/SWDchallenge?src=hashtag_click) submission ever. Went for a minimalist, monochrome plot with lots of white space and as little text as possible and an [@Apple](https://mobile.twitter.com/Apple) rebranding came to mind [#dataviz](https://mobile.twitter.com/hashtag/dataviz?src=hashtag_click)
